      "text": "We can stay a bit longer, and enjoy the sunset as the day ends. The Autumn forest is lovely at night, lights and colours guide lost souls to our home. \n\nAs a lost adventurer I think you would like to visit the Summer and Winter court too? \n I guessed as much... I can't stop those adventurer's impulses. But I must warn you the other Courts arent as welcoming, as Spring and Autumn.\n And there is another reason...\n\nI...uhm... kinda stole you away from both the Winter and Summer Court.\n They would both have claimed you as their own...and they would have send you to your inevitable end.\n I may not be able to stop you from going on adventures, but at least I can give you some nice memories, a good home and good company..."
